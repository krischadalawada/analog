The market will factor in the dire state of the economy in beating down the prices, as in any distress sale.<br>Sale of minority equity does not lead to a change in managerial control. Hence, the official attempt to differentiate its initiative from the earlier efforts seems feeble and incorrect.<br>PPP in infrastructure, a financial disaster: India did create world- class airports in Mumbai and Delhi and speeded up highway road reconstruction in PPP mode. <ul><li>However, after the 2008 financial crisis, due to lower demand and revenues for the indebted companies, many PPP projects failed to repay bank loans. Banks were left holding the non-performing assets (NPAs).</li></ul><br>Stock market risk: The currently high stock prices seem like a bubble with heightened uncertainties in the global financial market.<ul><li>The ”hot money” inflow that has fuelled Indian stock prices may eventually stop causing the market to crash.</li><li>Hot Money = Change in foreign exchange reserves – Net exports – Net foreign direct investmen</li><li>In other words, hot money is an inflow of foreign exchange reserves not related to actual exports or investment.</li></ul> <br>Economic slowdown: In 2020-21, the economy contracted by 8% due to the pandemic and lock- down, as in the annual report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Aggregate saving and investment rates (that is, as ratios of GDP) have (expectedly) contracted.<br>The potential threats of allegations of corruption and cronyism may derail the process.</p> <h2 style='text-align: start'>Case for debt monetization instead of asset monetisatio</h2><p style='text-align: start'>H Monetising debt: Instead of asset monetisation, monetising debt is a better option. It can be done with committed borrowing from the market and the central bank. p The financial system is flushed with liquidity as corporates are not borrowing bank credit. The proposed investment can be financed by government borrowing.<br>Lower cost of borrowing: The RBI’s annual report shows the weighted average cost of central government borrowings in 2020- 21 was 5.8%. And the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI-combined) was 6.2%.<br>Thus, with a negative 0.4% real interest rate (real interest rate is nominal interest rate minus inflation rate), domes- tic borrowing in home currency is easy.<br>Lesser risk of “Crowding-out” of private investment: Chances of crowding-out private investments are remote with excess liquidity in the market.<br>The crowding out effect is an economic theory arguing that rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates private sector spending.<br>It is a situation when increased interest rates lead to a reduction in private investment spending such that it dampens the initial increase of total investment spending.<br>No inflationary threat: Inflation risk is also limited with little aggregate demand pressures.<br>The rising public debt to GDP ratio is often red-flagged as a potential risk to rating downgrade by bond rating agencies. If the debt is productively used to expand GDP (the denominator), such risks are minimal.<br>Rising external debt by unstable portfolio investors carries a greater risk to external instability. The NMP document seems silent on how to overcome past mistakes. Hence, the NMP appears like a fire sale which may not help realise the best social value for public assets to kick-start investment demand. If reviving investment demand quickly is the real goal, debt monetisation seems a better option than asset monetisation. Such targeted borrowing, if quickly funnelled into infra- structure investment projects, could crowd-in (or bring in) private investment igniting a virtuous cycle of investment-led economic revival.</p></p><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>These are the major non-constitutional bodies in India but it does not include all the non-constitutional bodies.

        intro: 'In India, when the government is disposing of its governing functions, it will be carried out through different bodies. These bodies can be broadly classified into two categories one is constitutional bodies and the other is statutory bodies. Constitutional bodies are the bodies that are established through the constitutional provisions whereas the statutory bodies are bodies that are established through the statutes. The Non-constitutional bodies in India mainly include all the statutory bodies. Apart from the constitutional bodies, the non-constitutional bodies in India will be plenty in number because of the timely and needy establishment of them by the parliament and state legislatures.',
        content: "<h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>What is meant by a Non-constitutional body?</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>A non-constitutional body is an organization or institution which is not mentioned in the constitution of India. Unlike a constitutional body, a non-constitutional body does not derive its powers from the Indian constitution. Usually, a non-constitutional body derives its powers from corresponding laws passed by the Indian Parliament. There are also non-constitutional bodies that derive power based on Indian government orders called executive resolution. Based on how the body derives its power, non-constitutional bodies can be broadly classified into two –&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Statutory Bodies</strong> – They get the power from a statute i.e. an act enacted by the legislature. Eg: National Investigation Agency, National Human Rights Commission, Lokpal, and Lokayukta, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Statutory Bodies</strong> – They usually get the power from an executive order. Eg: NITI Aayog, National Development Council, etc</p></li></ul><p style='text-align: start'>Statutory Bodies can be further classified into two based on their roles and responsibilities. They are –&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Regulatory Bodies</strong> – A regulatory body is a government agency that is accountable for exercising autonomous authority over some area of human activity in a regulatory or supervisory capacity. However, their regulatory interventions are outside executive observation. Eg: Biodiversity authority of India, pension fund regulatory and development authority, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quasi-Judicial Bodies</strong> – Quasi-Judicial bodies are non-judicial bodies like commissions or tribunals which can interpret the law. They are different from judicial bodies in that their field is limited compared to a court. Eg: National green tribunal, National Human Rights Commission, Central Information Commission.</p></li></ul><p style='text-align: start'>Let us know the major non-constitutional bodies in India.</p><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>NITI Ayog</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>On the 13th of August 2014, the Modi Government scrapped the 65-year-old Planning Commission of India and replaced a new body called National Institution for Transforming India. Accordingly, on 1st January 2015, NITI Ayog was established as a successor to the planning commission. It is not created by the constitution nor by an act of parliament. Hence, it’s a non-constitutional body of India.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Composition and members:</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Chairperson – Prime minister, governing council, consists of chief minister of all states and UTs having legislatures and Lt colonel of UTs, Regional Council, Special Invitees.</p><img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/marco-oriolesi-wqLGlhjr6Og-unsplash.jpeg'><p></p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Composition and members</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>The CBI is headed by a director.

        intro: 'Unfortunately, humans have not been very good agents of the Earth over the years. To protect nature and preserve the planet for our children and future generations, we all need to take proactive steps toward cleaner living habits. Most of the damage to our nature stems from consumption: what we consume, how much we consume, and how often we do it. Whether it’s gas, clothing, food, furniture, cars, toys, water, electronics or other goods, we are all consumers. The key here is not to stop consuming, rather start being conscious of our consumption habits.',
        content: "<p>The good news is that it’s often not too expensive, difficult, or inconvenient to become more nature friendly. It can even be a fun challenge to implement among your coworkers or family. And though these small changes at the individual level may seem insignificant, just think how much cleaner the planet would be if everyone adopted even a few of the following behavior modifications.</p><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>So here are some ways you can start to protect nature today</strong></h2><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Consume less.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Restraining consumption can have a huge impact on nature. The three “R’s”—reduce, reuse and recycle— get a lot of attention, but the planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and most underrepresented “R”: refuse.</p><p style='text-align: start'>When you refuse, you say “no,” which is not easy at times. Freebies at events, cheap goods on clearance, the new children’s toys, or the latest gadgets promising to make your life better—none of these are essential. And they almost always end up either in the trash or are forgotten in the back of a closet. Next time you are enticed to purchase or accept a non-essential item, think about whether it would truly improve your life. If not, it’s ok to just say, no.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Compost.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Let your food and yard waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the landfill. In other words: compost. Composting your food scraps and yard waste offers great rewards: it keeps an incredible amount of trash out of the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to use in your garden.</p><img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/nature-compost.jpeg'><p>Some cities now pick up organic waste alongside regular trash. If your area doesn’t offer this service, no worries, you can always set up a low-maintenance compost pile in your backyard.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Choose reusable over single-use.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from disposable cups or disposable bottles, carrying disposable grocery bags, sipping from disposable straws, eating from disposable plates or containers, and using disposable utensils. All that single-use plastic has to go somewhere, and that has a devastating effect on our soil, oceans, and marine life.</p><p style='text-align: start'>All of the above items have more nature-responsible counterparts. Switch to using reusable items and make a commitment to use them as often as possible. You will have less trash piling up at your curb, and you will be helping to protect nature in a major way.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Upcycle more.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'><a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow' href='https://analogeducation.in/blog/'>Get creative</a> with your useless or unwanted items by upcycling, which means turning trash into treasure. Creating something new such as toys, artwork or jewellery is both satisfying and one of the best ways to protect nature. It keeps items out of the trash, as well as it can prevent having to purchase new items, which require lots of resources to produce. Children love making things, so instead of heading to the craft store, check out your recycle bin first and let their imaginations soar!</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Recycle properly.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>If you can’t refuse it or rot it then you can’t reduce it, and you can’t upcycle or reuse it, then the best option is to recycle it. Educate yourself on what can and cannot be recycled in your bins. Throwing the wrong items in the recycle bin <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow' href='https://www.analogeducation.in/'>can result</a> in an entire load being rejected, which means back to the landfill.</p><img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/recycle.jpeg'><p>You can also easily find out how to recycle special items such as batteries, electronics, and appliances. For drop-off sites check with your local municipality, and make an effort to get your items to the proper disposal sites.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Buy local.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>While we are on the topic of shopping, it’s important to think about the path your stuff takes just to get to you. All that packaging, combined with the fuel needed for delivery, really takes a toll on nature. Instead, check out your local farmers market for fresh, package-free food, try eating at a farm-to-table restaurant; and buy from local artists, clothing makers, and retailers before you click for that two-day shipping.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Use fewer chemicals.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Do you really want to protect nature? Then use fewer harmful chemicals and you’ll be on the right track. It’s hard to be sure about the long-term negative effects chemicals can have, both on our bodies and on the planet, so it’s best to avoid them if possible. Opt for chemical-free lawn and garden care; all-natural beauty and hygiene items; natural household cleaners; and organic food. The Earth will thank you!</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Walk, bike or carpool.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>For short trips, try walking or biking—you’ll also get a healthy dose of exercise, without stepping into a gym. If traveling on foot or two wheels isn’t feasible, try carpooling with a friend, neighbor, or coworker to a mutual destination. And if all else fails and you need to drive your car, line up errands in the most efficient route to save time and miles driven.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Use less water.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Conserving water at home is one of the easiest ways to protect nature. Think of all the times you consume water, both inside and outside your home; then, make adjustments as you can. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Turn off the tap while you brush your teeth.</p></li><li><p>Fix leaky faucets.</p></li><li><p>Make your water use more efficient by aerating faucets, using sprinklers that reduce runoff, and installing low-flow toilets and efficient showerheads.</p></li><li><p>Collect and use rainwater for watering plants.</p></li><li><p>Shorten your shower by a few minutes—or skip it altogether if you don’t really need one that day.</p></li><li><p>Only run your dishwasher or washing machine when it’s full</p></li></ul><p style='text-align: start'>These are just the basics—you can get really creative when it comes to conserving water.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Conserve electricity.</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>As you can guess, we’re quite fond of this method of protecting nature! Anytime you can use less electricity, it’s a win for the planet. Try some of these quick ways to conserve energy around your home:</p><ul><li><p>Trade incandescent bulbs for more energy-efficient CFLs or LEDs.</p></li><li><p>Use smart power strips, which turn off the power to electronics when they’re not being used.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Use a programmable or smart thermostat.</p></li><li><p>Maintain your heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system.</p></li><li><p>When it’s time to buy a new appliance, choose an Energy Star-certified model.</p></li><li><p>Seal air leaks around doors and windows.</p></li><li><p>Make sure your home is properly insulated to the recommended level of heat resistance for where you live.</p></li><li><p>Use ceiling fans to circulate warm air in the winter and cold air in the summer.</p></li></ul>",

        intro: 'Income tax was introduced in India by Sir James Wilson on July 24, 1860, to compensate the British government for the losses incurred during the First War of Independence in the year 1857.  The Income Tax department marked Friday as the 160th Income Tax Day or Aaykar Diwas. Income Tax day has been celebrated on July 24 in India since 2010. The income tax department decided to mark July 24 in 2010 as the day for the annual celebration to mark 150 years of this levy from that year onwards. Income tax was first levied as a duty in the year 1860 and the authority to levy that duty came into force on July 24 of that year.',

        intro: 'The Indian Goods and Service Tax (GST) was introduced in the financial structure of the Indian economy on 1st July 2017. The primary objective of GST was to eliminate all indirect tax brackets like entertainment tax, excise tax, value-added tax and service tax and merging all the tax entities into one single tax bracket with variable percentages. Upon its introduction, it has had a positive impact of GST on the Indian economy which can be justified through the explanation of the following points-',
        content: "<img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/gst-2.jpeg'><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Impact of GST on Indian Economy</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>The introduction of GST has had many positive impacts on the growth and expansion of the Indian economic structure. The primary impacts include-</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Fostering Economic Growth and Production</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>The first prerequisite that GST has fulfilled is the resultant growth and expansion of the Indian economy. With the abolition of the tax structure, a uniform rate of 30% tax was introduced through the application of GST. Since the overall tax burden for the ultimate consumers reduced considerably, the consumption criteria were strengthened and there was accelerated purchase in the economy from the buyer’s side. To complement the demand, the production facilities grew and expanded. The producers encourages to produce more thereby leading to equivalent growth in the production processes and mechanisms.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Support for Small and Medium Scale Businesses (SME)</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>GST has had a tremendous impact on the growth of the small and medium scale business (SME). They can now register under the GST Composition Scheme. Under the aforementioned tax scheme, the businesses would pay tax according to the proportion of their annual turnover. This scheme introduces to reduce the GST burden of companies and thereby encourage sales and revenue mechanisms in these business organizations. For example- SME businesses with a turnover of 1.5 crores annually have to pay a GST of 1% according to the GST Composition Scheme. In other cases, a business with an annual turnover of 50 lakh had to pay a GST of 6%.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Enhancing Pan-India Transportation Activities</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Earlier, transportation activities hampers owing to the presence of additional taxation systems at check posts and toll plazas. Here the vehicles passing through the aforementioned areas had to pay a significant percentage of their business income as toll tax. Unnecessary delay in such situations would cause damage to the transportable goods which at times included Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) products. These perishable goods had a small restoration period. Therefore a high amount of money has been on warehousing and storage. Thus, to reduce such overhead expenditures, a uniform Taxation system under GST was introduced.</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Increase in Exports</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>The introduction of GST into the Indian economic structure has reduced the quantum of custom duty. Custom Duties refer to the transport charges that were levied for the movement of the goods from the docks to the retailer and wholesaler markets. The cost of production for the local markets was also lowered upon the incorporation of GST. This encouraged local players to produce more commodities. Thereby competition in the market structure grew exponentially. Local players steps into the market without any restrictions that impose upon their entry. Companies became more competitive when it comes to expanding their businesses globally upon the introduction of GST.&nbsp;</p><img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/gst-3.svg'><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>Thereby the introduction of GST in the Indian economy has been instrumental for the application of business principles. It also encourage the growth of economic structures in the country. GST has considerably reduced the consumer tax burden. It is beneficial tool for augmenting financial resources in the country.&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: start'>We, at&nbsp;<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow' href='http://www.analogeducation.in/'>Analog IAS Academy</a>, help the youth of our country prepare for these examinations through our Daily News Analysis on our&nbsp;<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow' href='https://t.me/analogiasacademy'>Telegram channel</a>.

        intro: 'The Indian Parliamentary system is the existing system of governance in the country. The Constitution of India framed and drafted through the regulations of the Constituent Assembly in 1949, had given the powers to the Indian Parliament to run the judiciary and executive functioning of the country. Following features and advantages associated with the Indian Parliament would be sufficient in informing us about the origin and operation of the Indian Democratic System-',
        content: "<h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Features of Indian Parliament</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>The Indian Parliamentary system comprises the structural reforms and guidelines upon which the framework of Indian polity is based. Following are a few basic features of the Indian Parliament–</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Nominal Head and Real Head</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Under the Parliamentary system of democracy existing in the country, there is a division between the real head and nominal head. The President is the nominal head of the country. He has the signatory authority to all the bills and amendments in the constitution. But it is an ornamental post.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Majority Party is the Ruling Party</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>In the Indian Parliamentary system, the political party that achieves a majority through the voting mechanism is considered to be the ruling party. A ruling party has to win the Union Elections or the Lok Sabha Elections to nominate the representatives who will be at the forefront of the party while convening functions in the Indian Parliament. The majority party or the ruling party is responsible for taking decisions in the parliamentary functioning.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Presence of Parliamentary Opposition</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>No party in the lower house of the Indian Parliament or Lok Sabha can attain a 100% majority. The leader of the Opposition holds an important portfolio in the Union Government as a figure of dissent responsible for challenging the decision-making authority of the ruling party.&nbsp;</p><img src='https://analogeducation.in/assets/images/blog/indian_parliament.jpeg'><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Advantages of the Indian Parliamentary System</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>The Bicameral structure of the Indian Parliamentary System is considered to be a role model in the functioning of government structures worldwide. It offers the following advantages-</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Prevents Authoritarianism</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>Autocratic governments all across the world have met their consequential downfall. This has happened owing to the excessive powers that the dictators have wielded in majority circumstances. Therefore a democratic system of Government, one which exists in the Indian Parliamentary system is most beneficial. Here the constitutional head or the ruling party cannot act like a dictator since the public mandate is an important part of their election process.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Better Coordination between Executive and Legislature</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>The executive is a part of the legislature. The primary responsibility of the legislature is to introduce laws and regulations into the Parliamentary system. On the other hand, the responsibility of the executive is to implement the laws introduced. Therefore since a majority party rule exists in the Indian Parliamentary system of government, the chances of conflicts and disagreements reduce automatically. Better coordination and support exist and therefore both executive and legislature are capable of performing their work independently.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Representatives from all ethnic backgrounds</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>An Indian Parliamentary system comprises representation from the social and cultural backgrounds of the population structure. In a parliamentary functioning, people from all castes, creeds, religions and ethnic backgrounds can participate in the decision-making process. Therefore equal representation aids the process of introducing diversity in the functioning of the Indian political structure. Since the voices of all the sections of the population are represented, the Indian Parliamentary system is a perfect example of existing diversity.&nbsp;</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Availability of Alternate Government</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>One of the biggest advantages of the Indian Parliamentary system of governance is the presence of alternate forms of government. When the ruling party is unable to function properly, the opposition party has the power to introduce a bill which is known as the act of no-confidence motion. This can lead to the ouster of the ruling party.&nbsp;</p><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>Therefore the Indian Parliamentary System of Government is taken as a reference point while framing the constitutional model of other major and developed countries in the world. It is one of the lengthiest constitutional structures in the world. Thus the advantages and features describe the importance of a parliamentary system of governance.&nbsp;</p><h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'><strong>What are the basic divisions in the Indian Parliamentary system?</strong></p><p style='text-align: start'>The Indian Parliamentary system is the existing system of governance in the country.

        content: "<h2 style='text-align: start'><strong>Why NCERT is important for UPSC</strong></h2><p style='text-align: start'>NCERT Books are an important part of the UPSC Curriculum owing to the following reasons-</p><h3 style='text-align: start'><strong>Simplicity</strong></h3><p style='text-align: start'>The NCERT Books are written in simple and <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer nofollow' href='http://www.lucidlanguage.net/'>lucid languages</a>.

For studying each book you must approximately require 3.5-4 days. This means that for completing the entire NCERT Curriculum you would require close to 3-4 months.
