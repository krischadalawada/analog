After attending economy classes which you taught us I decided to pursue course in economics in international universities after I get into service. The openness and attitude which you indirectly impose on us is greatly helping us in taking UPSC challenge and failure as stepping stone to success. Always grateful to you sir.'

Geography is the only subject that was totally alien to me and physical geography being a technical subject appeared quite formidable. The subject was made easy by Priyesh Sir and I am really glad to inform you all that I have secured better marks in General Studies Paper 1 than other GS papers. I thank Priyesh Sir from the bottom of my heart for all his support! I also wish all the very best to the aspirants who are going to appear for the preliminary examination on 18th of June. Believe that you can do it and you will do it!'
